## Defining productivity for a product manager

As a product manager, we are responsible for the success of your product, and also we are responsible for a lot of moving parts around our product.

This means that you need to be productive in order to achieve your goals.

But what does productivity mean for a product manager?

When it comes to productivity, there's no one-size-fits-all solution. What works for one person might not work for another.

So, what is productivity in general?

Put simply, it's a measure of how efficiently you use your time and resources to achieve your desired results.

> A productive product manager gets the right things done, and does them right.

Specifically for a product manager, there are a few different ways to define productivity.

1. One definition is the ability to get things done efficiently and effectively. This means being able to plan and execute your work in a way that maximizes your results.
2. Another definition of productivity for a product manager is our inventivity:

   1. To be creative and think outside the box.
   2. To generate new ideas and bring them to life.
   3. To come up with new ways to improve your product.

The best way to be productive as a product manager is to find a balance between these two definitions.

## Tips and tricks to help boost productivity

The first step to being productive as a product manager is to define your process. What works for you may not work for someone else, so it's important to find a system that works for you and stick to it. There are a few things to consider when defining your process:

* What is your goal? What do you want to achieve with your product?
* Who is your audience? Who will you be making your product for?
* What is your timeline? When do you need to have your product finished by?

I'll describe here the tips that made me a better product manager, but not all of them may apply to you. Pick and choose the ones relevant and feel free to discard the others.

### Manage what needs to be done

#### Start your day with a plan

* Set a daily goal Each day, set a goal for yourself. This could be anything from completing a certain task to making progress on a project. Having a daily goal will help you stay on track and motivated.
* Create a Todo List Write out a to-do list of everything you need to accomplish and make sure you stick to it.

* Set a schedule One of the biggest productivity killers is trying to do too much in too little time. You should create a schedule that is realistic and allows for some flexibility. Make sure to allow for breaks and time to deal with unexpected tasks.
* Break up your day into smaller chunks

  *   Dedicate certain periods of time to specific tasks. For example, you can spend the first hour of your day answering emails, the next hour on a conference call, and the next hour working on a presentation.
  *   Once you know what you need to do and by when, break it down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This will make it feel less daunting and help you stay on track.
* Set Deadlines

  *   If you don't have a sense of urgency, it's easy to push things off until "later." By setting a deadline, you'll force yourself to focus and get things done.
  *   Having a deadline will help you focus and get the task done.

#### Set realistic goals

As a product manager, you are responsible for a lot of different things. From developing product strategy to managing product development to working with customers and partners, there are a lot of balls to keep in the air.

That's why it's so important to have a clear understanding of your goals. What are you trying to achieve? What are your priorities?

Once you know your goals, you can start to develop a plan for how to achieve them.

Before you can start hacking away at your productivity, you need to define what you're trying to achieve. Whether it's shipping a new product, improving an existing one, or simply getting through your never-ending to-do list, take a moment to think about what you want to accomplish.

* Set goals for yourself

It's important to set realistic goals for yourself as a product manager. If you set goals that are too lofty, you're likely to get frustrated and give up. On the other hand, if you set goals that are too small, you'll never challenge yourself and you'll never reach your full potential.

Find a safe middle ground and set goals that push you to be your best self.

* Set Goals for the team

As important as setting goals for yourself, it is important that you and your team have a clear understanding of what you are trying to achieve. You should set specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (S.M.A.R.T.) goals.

This will help to keep everyone focused and on track.

#### Prioritize efficiently

A product manager should focus on the most important tasks. There are always a million things that need to be done, but not all of them are equally important. The product manager should prioritize the tasks that will have the biggest impact on the product.

There are many frameworks available to help a product manager prioritize tasks. You may choose one, many or even none of them. What is important is to stay consistent in your prioritization methodology. This will help your stakeholders and your teams understand what your approach is in determining what should be done to achieve the best of your product.

I will list down here some of the frameworks that I like to use.

##### Leveraged Neutral Overhead

Focus on tasks that have maximum leverage (impact)

#### Delegate tasks

If you have team members, make sure you are delegating tasks that they can handle. This will free up your time to focus on more important tasks.

build a strong network of people you can rely on.

If you find yourself with too much on your plate, delegate! Product managers need to be good at delegating tasks. This will help you stay focused on the most important tasks and get help from others. Choose people who you trust to complete the tasks and provide clear instructions.

### Stay organized

Another important productivity hack for product managers is to stay organized. Staying organized will help you stay on track and ensure that you're meeting deadlines.

This means having a place for everything and keeping your work space clean.

A cluttered work space can lead to a cluttered mind, which will make you less productive.

This includes both your physical space and your digital space. Make sure your work area is clean and clutter-free. This will help you focus on your tasks. Additionally, keep your files and folders organized. This will help you find things quickly and avoid wasting time searching for things.

#### Eliminate distractions, Identify time-wasting activities

Turn off your email, close social media tabs, and put your phone silent. This will help you focus on the task at hand and get it done quicker.

#### Don’t Multi-Task

One of the biggest productivity killers is multi-tasking. When you try to do too many things at once, you end up doing all of them poorly. Instead of multi-tasking, focus on one task at a time and give it your full attention. You’ll be surprised at how much more you can get done.

This doesn't mean fully completing a project before starting another! Be able to break down multiple smaller chunks, and then focus on a single chink at a time.

#### Keep things documented

Use PRD, minutes of meetings.

Keeping a journal can also help you track your progress and stay motivated. Every day, write down what you accomplished. This will help you see how much you're getting done and give you a sense of satisfaction. And if you're feeling stuck, looking back at your journal can help you identify what's been holding you back.

#### Use tools

There are a lot of tools and resources available to help product managers be more productive. Utilize them!

### Overcome obstacles and stay motivated

#### Improve your Well-Being

* Get Enough Sleep

  *   It’s important to get enough sleep if you want to be productive. When you’re well-rested, you’ll be able to focus and get more done. So, make sure you’re getting enough sleep each night.
* Get up earlier

  *   This may not be possible for everyone, but if you can make it happen, getting up earlier can be a game-changer. Use that extra time to get ahead on your work for the day, or use it to get some exercise in before starting your day. You'll be surprised at how much more energized you feel when you start your day with a little bit of extra time.
* Take breaks throughout the day

  *   Get up and walk around, get some fresh air, or take a quick power nap. These breaks will help you recharge and be more productive when you return to your work.
  *   It's important to take breaks when you're working on a product. If you try to work non-stop, you'll quickly become burnt out and your productivity will suffer. Take a few minutes every few hours to step away from your work and clear your head. Go for a walk, grab a coffee, or chat with a colleague. Taking breaks will help you stay refreshed and focused.
* Reward yourself

  *   Once you accomplish a task, give yourself a small reward. This could be something like grabbing a coffee, or watching a short video. Rewarding yourself will help you stay motivated and productive.

#### Be flexible

Things change, and you need to be able to adapt. Don’t get too attached to your plan – be willing to make changes as necessary.

#### Be patient

Productivity doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time and effort to see results. Be patient and stay focused on your goals.

#### Just start

It's easy to get stuck in the planning phase and never actually start working on your goal. But the only way to get things done is to start. So, take a deep breath and just begin.

#### Believe in yourself

The most important productivity hack is to believe in yourself. You need to believe that you can get the job done. This positive attitude will help you stay motivated and focused on your goals. And if you're feeling doubtful, remember that you've accomplished great things in the past. You can do it again!

#### Keep learning

Product managers need to be constantly learning to stay ahead of the curve. This means keeping up with industry news, reading blogs and articles, and attending conferences and webinars.

## The dark side of productivity for a product manager

Productivity is often seen as a key success factor for product managers. After all, if a product manager can't get things done, how can they expect to successfully manage a product? However, while productivity is important, it's not the only thing that product managers need to focus on.

In fact, productivity can actually have a negative impact on a product manager's career if it's not managed properly. Here are three ways that productivity can backfire on product managers:

### Productivity can lead to burnout

If a product manager is constantly pushing themselves to be more productive, they can quickly become burnt out. This can lead to them feeling overwhelmed and stressed, which can affect their ability to make decisions and do their job properly.

### Productivity can make a product manager seem inflexible

If a product manager is too focused on being productive, they may seem inflexible to others. This can make it difficult to build relationships with other stakeholders and get buy-in for their ideas.

### Productivity can make a product manager look like a robot

If a product manager is always focusing on productivity, they may start to seem like robots to others. This can make them seem cold and impersonal, which can damage their reputation and make it difficult to build trust with others.

Productivity is important for product managers, but it's not the only thing that they need to focus on. Product managers need to strike a balance between productivity and other factors, such as relationships and reputation, to be successful.

## The impact of productivity on a product manager's career

The impact of productivity on a product manager's career is huge.

By being able to manage their time and resources effectively, product managers can increase their chances of success.

A product manager who is able to get things done quickly and efficiently is going to be much more successful than one who struggles to get things done.

A productive product manager is able to get more done in less time, which can lead to promotions and raises. Additionally, a productive product manager is more likely to be able to take on more responsibility and projects, leading to a more successful career.
